Linear Data Structures:
Array: Sequential arrangements of data elements of a single data type linked to its index.
Linked List: Each data element is linked to another data element along with the data present in it.
Stack: Follows a specific order of operation. Last In First Out or First In Last Out.
Queue: Follows a specific order of operation. First In First Out.
Matrix: Two dimensional data structure in which data element are addressed by a pair of indices.

Non-Linear Data Structures:
Binary Tree:
Heap:
Hash Table:
Graph:

Python Specific Data Structures:
Tuple: immutable list, they can only be read. (used for credentials/sockets)
Dictionary: key-value pair as its data elements
List: Sequential arrangement of data elements of any type mapped to its index.
